Stimulate with pattern as stimulus (various patterns of stimuli, pattern A, B)
When pattern A is used, use specific neutrons, when pattern B is used, use specific neurons
N = 100, 1000 (iterations)


Can I show some neurons become responsive to some stimuli (patterns) -> selectivity

(Using all neurons would mean less selectivity , less variability)

50% of excitatory neurons -> pA
50% of excitatory neurons -> pB

pairwise bernoulli values for probability (e = excitatory, i = inhibitory)
e to e: 0.25, e to i: 0.15, i to e: 0.3; i to i: 0.05
